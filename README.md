### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹                             

I'm Matt â€” a Data Science junior at UC Berkeley, as well as coach and occasional team captain of [3 Ways to Heck](https://github.com/3-Ways-to-Heck), a champion cybersecurity team I established in high school with a couple friends competing in many CTFs and competitions.

I have a couple of silly projects in here from learning web dev, but I'm primarily interested in PM or SWE (specifically SRE/DevOps/security). Feel free to reach out via my website or LinkedIn.
