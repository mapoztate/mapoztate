### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹                             

I'm Matt â€” a Data Science major at UC Berkeley, as well as coach and occasional team captain of [3 Ways to Heck](https://github.com/3-Ways-to-Heck), a renowned cybersecurity team I established in high school with a couple friends. 

Currently, I'm exploring software engineering (security, SRE, DevOps), data (eg: ML), and product, but work on any project I find interesting here. Feel free to reach out via my website or LinkedIn.
