### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹                             

I'm Matt â€” a Data Science major at UC Berkeley, as well as coach and occasional team captain of [3 Ways to Heck](https://github.com/3-Ways-to-Heck), a renowned cybersecurity team I established in high school with a couple friends. 

Currently, I'm exploring adjacent topics in data engineering including security, virtualization, and product, with research interests in edtech/K-14 CS pedagogy. Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn.
