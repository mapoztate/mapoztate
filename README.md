### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Too lazy to actually put info here so deal with GitHub's default!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my CS and IT background...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me and find out more: [mprado.ml/](http://www.mprado.ml/socials)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a training portal for cybersecurity newbies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, HTML & CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on StonksCTF, a introductory cybersecurity competition.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm dumping all of my AP Computer Science A work here so I can use Edhesive as an online IDE and to help future students out.
