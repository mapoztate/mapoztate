# Berkeley Summer Experience 2022
I went to Berkeley Summer Experience, a one-day, invite-only workshop that allows prospective high school seniors and community college tranfer students to figure out more about the UC application, life @ Cal, and to personally meet their admissions officer. I left this mostly in the words of the admissions officers - I posted on my own thoughts on my [website.](https://mapoztate.com/) Remember, this is only in the eyes of Berkeley admissions officers. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at matt@mapoztate.com!

**How is admission decided?**
<br> Admission is a comprehensive review; see [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71365470/184783930-0eeb6e5e-ebda-402a-a67d-d26c73519412.jpg) image for more detail. Transfer students are only decided on GE, units, GPA, and major prep, but that is bundled alongside course rigor if you are a freshman. Decisions will be released late March.

**How do admissions rates work?** <br>
Note: this is really complicating but I hope this explains it
* THE COLLEGE YOUR MAJOR APPLIES TO AFFECTS YOUR ACCEPTANCE RATE, NOT YOUR MAJOR. Exceptions are EECS and any dual degree programs.
* For Berkeley, if you are applying to anything other than L&S (Letters & Science), make sure to put that as your primary so it's the admissions officer's priority. If you get admitted any college, you can pick any of the majors within it.
* Trying to get in backdoor does not work. (or so they say)
* Applying undecided does not hurt your chances of getting in - in fact, nothing on the app can.
* However, applying to a major that your ECs/courseload does revolve around increases your chances.
* Make sure to not put two impacted majors from the same college as your primary and alternate.
* Your alternate may or may not be considered; it's purely up to the admissions officer.
* Take for example [my choices:](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71365470/184790012-322d082b-f0b0-473c-8ac7-7f5dfb9a7cb1.png) notice how I *try* (Berkeley is the exception since L&S has everything, but no two impacted majors) to diversify the colleges for the majors that I am interested in for each campus.

**PIQs** <br>
General advice - 
* Keep the exposition of your anecdote short - it should take around 100 words at most.
* Don't summarrize the brag sheet, but don't be afraid to brag.
* Make it a reflection and keep it about you.
* PIQs should tackle different aspects of your personality - they should not be about the same thing.
* Free-write first, then trim the fat off to make it 350 words.
* Do's and dont's: please refer to [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71365470/184787242-c2acf211-67bb-43cc-bd4f-7e12be0fdcae.jpg) image.

* Different types of creativity

* How does this lead to opportunities inside/outside the classroom?
* Try to paint a picture - make a story arc with exposition, rising action, climax, etc. etc.

Using the additional comments section - 
* It's the last section the officers see, so if you want to use that as a spot to put question #8, feel free.
* It can also be used to explain - 
  *  A bad grade, semester, or grade trend
  *  Explain additional background information not in another part of the app
  *  Expand on ECs if there was no more room
  *  Telling the officer any information that would require additional context

<hr> 

**Q&A** 
<br> If you've earned IGETC certification or earned an AA/AS, where would you signify that as a freshman applicant?
* Put that in additional comments. Feel free to divide additional comments in explaining your circumstances, as well as anything else you want to put (eg: running out of room in additional comments in the academics section). 


Is it possible to combine experiences into categories?
* Yes, if you are running out of space or need to make room for stronger ones.


How many people read your UC application?
* For freshman applicants, your app typically is handed between 2-3 people.


Should describing ECs be more written as a narrative or as resume points?
* It works both ways, as long as you can describe your impact, although it is easier to describe with points.


Where should certifications/MOOCs go under?
* Put them under awards.


What should you if you are waitlisted in the university?
* Accept another school's offer - you'll hear back from the waitlist late Summer.


Is there any preference toward CC/AP/IB/H?
* No.


If you've exhausted your school's course catalog, will you be deducted for have bad rigor?
* No, but we hope you've supplemented it with ECs or classes from another institution. Make sure to list this on your additional comments section.


Do you need Letters of Recommendation?
* LoRs will only be asked on an as-needed basis. You are not required to submit LoRs from your email, but they do allow the reader to get more information about you which can be the point whether you are admitted or not.
